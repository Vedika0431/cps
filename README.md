# Captcha Solver ApplicationThis project provides a simple, client-side web application for solving a basic captcha challenge. It's built with HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive user interface.## Features- Displays a captcha image.- Accepts user input for the captcha solution.- Validates the user's input against a predefined correct answer.- Responsive design for various screen sizes.## Getting Started### PrerequisitesNo specific prerequisites are needed other than a web browser.### Usage1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.2.  **Captcha Display:** By default, the application will display `sample.png` as the captcha image.3.  **Custom Captcha URL:** You can provide a custom image URL for the captcha by appending a `?url=` query parameter to the URL in your browser's address bar.For example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://example.com/some-other-image.png` (Note: Due to browser security policies, directly linking to images from external domains might be restricted when opening `index.html` as a local file. Hosting on a web server resolves this.)4.  **Solve the Captcha:** Type your answer into the input field.5.  **Submit:** Click the "Submit" button to check your answer. The application will indicate whether your answer is correct or incorrect.## Captcha LogicThe current implementation assumes the correct answer for the provided `sample.png` (or any image visually matching "ADCRB") is "ADCRB". The validation is case-insensitive.## Project Structure```- index.html   # Main application file- sample.png   # Default captcha image- README.md    # Project documentation- LICENSE      # MIT License information```## Technologies Used-   **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.-   **JavaScript**: Client-side logic for captcha handling and validation.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
